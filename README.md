# Contoso Claims - Multi-Agent Insurance Claims Platform

An **Agentic AI Claims Demo** powered by advanced multi-agent systems leveraging **Microsoft Agent Framework** and **Azure OpenAI (gpt-5.3-chat)**, designed to streamline and enhance the end-to-end insurance claims process. This proof-of-concept showcases a cutting-edge architecture in which specialized AI agents collaboratively assess claims, delivering instant, transparent, and explainable recommendations directly to claims processors. By augmenting human decision-making, the solution significantly accelerates claim handling—reducing processing time from hours to minutes—while enhancing consistency, transparency, and customer satisfaction.

## 🎯 What This Demo Showcases

### Multi-Agent Architecture
Unlike traditional single-model AI systems, Contoso Claims employs a **collaborative multi-agent approach** where specialized AI agents work together:

- **🔍 Claim Assessor Agent** - Analyzes damage photos, evaluates repair costs, and validates claim consistency
- **📋 Policy Checker Agent** - Verifies coverage terms, searches policy documents, and determines claim eligibility  
- **⚠️ Risk Analyst Agent** - Detects fraud patterns, analyzes claimant history, and assesses risk factors
- **📧 Communication Agent** - Generates personalized customer emails and requests missing documentation
- **👨‍💼 Supervisor Agent** - Orchestrates the workflow and synthesizes final recommendations

### Agent Behaviors & Capabilities

#### Claim Assessor
- **Multimodal Analysis**: Processes damage photos using Azure OpenAI LLMs with vision Capabilities
- **Cost Validation**: Cross-references repair estimates with vehicle specifications
- **Documentation Review**: Evaluates completeness of supporting evidence
- **Damage Assessment**: Provides detailed analysis of incident consistency

#### Policy Checker  
- **Coverage Verification**: Searches policy documents using semantic similarity
- **Multi-language Support**: Handles both English and Dutch insurance policies
- **Exclusion Analysis**: Identifies policy limitations and coverage gaps
- **Intelligent Search**: Uses vector embeddings for accurate policy matching

#### Risk Analyst
- **Fraud Detection**: Analyzes patterns indicative of fraudulent claims
- **History Analysis**: Reviews claimant's previous claim patterns
- **Risk Scoring**: Provides quantitative risk assessments
- **Red Flag Identification**: Highlights suspicious claim elements

#### Communication Agent
- **Personalized Messaging**: Crafts contextual customer communications
- **Missing Document Requests**: Generates specific requests for additional evidence
- **Professional Tone**: Maintains appropriate insurance industry language
- **Template Generation**: Creates reusable communication templates

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Multi-Agent Framework**: Microsoft Agent Framework with supervisor pattern
- **AI Provider**: Azure OpenAI (`gpt-5.3-chat`) using Microsoft Entra ID authentication
- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with React 19 and shadcn/ui
- **Search**: FAISS vector database for policy retrieval (to be replaced with Azure AI Search in Prod Environments)
- **Infrastructure**: Azure Container Apps

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 18+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for Python dependency management
- Azure OpenAI account (optional - falls back to mock responses)


### Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5433/claims_app
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5433/claims_app_test
DATABASE_POOL_SIZE=5
DATABASE_MAX_OVERFLOW=10
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-5.3-chat
AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-large
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=preview
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENTS_API_VERSION=2024-10-21
```

Run `az login` locally. In Azure, the Container Apps managed identity is granted the Cognitive Services OpenAI User role and local key-based auth is disabled on the Azure OpenAI account.

### Backend Setup
```bash
docker compose up -d postgres
cd backend
uv run fastapi dev
```
The compose database is exposed on `127.0.0.1:5433` by default to avoid conflicts with an existing local PostgreSQL service on `5432`.

The API will be available at http://localhost:8000

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000

### Single-Command Dev Workflow
From the repo root, you can run the full local stack with auto reload:
```bash
make install
make dev
```

This starts:
- PostgreSQL via Docker Compose
- The FastAPI server with `uvicorn --reload`
- The Next.js dev server

Use `Ctrl+C` to stop the app servers and `make stop` to stop PostgreSQL.


## 🌐 Azure Deployment

### Prerequisites
- [Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/)
- Azure subscription with appropriate permissions

### Deploy to Azure Container Apps
```bash
# Login to Azure
azd auth login

# Initialize and deploy
azd up
```

If `azd up` finishes provisioning but fails with:

```text
extension azure.ai.agents project hook postdeploy failed: AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT is not set in the environment
```

the failure is from the optional preview `azure.ai.agents` azd extension, not this application. This repo deploys Azure OpenAI directly and does not provision a Foundry AI Project, so either temporarily uninstall that extension with `azd extension uninstall azure.ai.agents` before rerunning `azd up`, or set up a real Foundry project endpoint if you intentionally use that extension outside this app.

This will:
1. Create Azure Container Apps environment
2. Set up container registry with managed identity
3. Provision a private Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server
4. Deploy both frontend and backend containers
5. Configure networking, private DNS, and CORS policies
5. Output the deployed application URLs

### Infrastructure
The deployment creates:
- **Container Apps Environment** with consumption-based scaling
- **Virtual Network** with Container Apps and PostgreSQL subnets
- **Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server** with private access
- **Private DNS Zone** for database name resolution
- **Azure Container Registry** for image storage
- **Managed Identity** for secure registry access
- **Log Analytics Workspace** for monitoring
- **HTTPS endpoints** with automatic SSL certificates

## 🎮 Demo Scenarios

### Individual Agent Testing
- `/agents/claim-assessor` to test damage photo analysis
- `/agents/policy-checker` to verify coverage scenarios
- `/agents/risk-analyst` for fraud detection demos
- `/agents/communication-agent` for email generation

### Complete Workflow
- Go to `/demo` for end-to-end claim processing
- Upload damage photos and watch multimodal analysis
- See agents collaborate in real-time
- Review final assessment with full reasoning

### Sample Claims
The system includes realistic test scenarios:
- Standard auto collision claim
- High-value vehicle damage
- Dutch language insurance claim
